-Every match has 15 chances when a team could score <- either team 1 or team 2 (random number either 1 or 2)

-To get a shot on goal the following stats are added together:
    Midfielder: getFitness, getPassingAccuracy, getPositioning, getDribbling, getChanceCreation
    Forward: getFitness, getPositioning, getDribbling, getChanceCreation, ShotAccuracy, ShotFrequency
    Manager: getAbility,getRespect,getBelief,getKnowledge
-Even if the team got a shot on goal there is a chance that the defense may intercept/ goal-keeper saves it
-To get that probability I added:
    Goal-Keeper: getFitness,getPassingAccuracy,getPositioning
    Defender: getFitness,getPassingAccuracy,getDefensiveness,getDribbling
    Manager: getAbility,getRespect,getBelief,getKnowledge

-Group Stage allows draws
-After the group Stage there must always be a winner:
-If the score is a draw then go to penalty shoot-outs then sudden death
-Set the order: Forwards,Midfielders,Defenders and then Goal-Keeper
-Players penalty probability: getFitness,getShotAccuracy,getShotFrequency,getPositioning and every position get their bonus:
    Forward: 25
    Midfielders: 10
    Defenders: 0
    Goal-Keeper: 5
-Goal-Keeper saves penalty probability: (getFitness,getOffSideAdherence,getPositioning)*10

^Same stages as in world cup
